						<p>I currently do engineering at <a href="https://cleartax.in/" target="_blank">ClearTax</a>, where our goal is to simplify financial lives of consumers and businesses in India. Taxes, investments, finance are hard but ClearTax is building some really good solutions in this domain.</p>

						<p>I am also trying to bring together a few communities. I started <a href="https://github.com/learn-awesome/learn-awesome#readme" target="_blank">LearnAwesome</a> where we are building humanity's universal skills graph by collecting the best learning resources from the Web on various topics. Then, there is the blockchain developer community, <a href="https://indium.network/" target="_blank">Indium.Network</a>, who are trying to bootstrap their own cryptocurrency. And finally, I started helping out a bit with <a href="https://twitter.com/helix_learn" target="_blank">Helix Learning</a> which is an experiential learning space for young children. They're planning to hold a month-long summer camp for kids from all over the country.

						<p>On the music-making front, things have slowed down a bit since I moved to Bangalore, although, I did start playing the keyboard recently. Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqXsIY9Sp0" target="_blank">Pehla Nasha cover by Chetan Ghodeshwar</a> is what gave me the final nudge. BlackStratBlues continues to be the favorite. I have also started enjoying Led Zeppelin and Queen a lot more :) </p>
