						<p>I recently joined the engineering team at <a href="https://www.hypertrack.com/" target="_blank">HyperTrack</a>, where our goal is to bring world-class location tracking to apps. There's a clear gap/opportunity between operating systems and mapping platforms which I'm very excited to pursue.</p>

						<p>I am also trying to bring together a few communities. I started <a href="https://mathsjam.com/cities/bangalore/" target="_blank">MathsJam</a> monthly meetups in Bangalore where we mostly play games &amp; puzzles. Then, there is the blockchain developer community, <a href="https://indium.org.in/" target="_blank">Indium</a>, who are trying to bootstrap their own cryptocurrency. And finally, I started helping out a bit with <a href="https://twitter.com/helix_learn" target="_blank">Helix Learning</a> which is an experiential learning space for young children.

						<p>On the music-making front, things have slowed down a bit since I moved to Bangalore, although, I did start playing the keyboard recently. Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqXsIY9Sp0" target="_blank">Pehla Nasha cover by Chetan Ghodeshwar</a> is what gave me the final nudge. I have also started enjoying Led Zeppelin and Queen a lot more :) </p>
