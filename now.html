						<p>I currently do engineering at <a href="https://cleartax.in/" target="_blank">ClearTax</a>, where our goal is to simplify financial lives of consumers and businesses in India. Taxes, investments, finance are hard but ClearTax is building some really good solutions in this domain.</p>

						<p>I am also helping with building a few communities. Some of us started <a href="https://learnawesome.org/" target="_blank">LearnAwesome.Org</a> where we are building humanity's universal learning map by collecting the best learning resources from the Web on various topics. Then, there is the blockchain developer community, <a href="https://indium.network/" target="_blank">Indium.Network</a>, who are building a optimized-for-dapps blockchain. Another initiative is <a href="https://polyglot.network" target="_blank">Polyglot.Network</a> which will be an open-source software development agency. And finally, along with a few recreational mathematics enthusiasts, we're trying to ubild the first ever mathematics museum in India. Hoping to make good progress on this in the coming weeks.</p>

						<p>On the music-making front, things have slowed down a bit since I moved to Bangalore, although, I did start playing the keyboard recently. Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqXsIY9Sp0" target="_blank">Pehla Nasha cover by Chetan Ghodeshwar</a> is what gave me the final nudge. BlackStratBlues continues to be the favorite. I have also started enjoying Led Zeppelin and Queen a lot more :) </p>
