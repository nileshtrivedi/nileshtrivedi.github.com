               <h4>Use An Algorithm As Your Passward.</h4><small>06 Dec 2012</small>
									    				<p>If you want strong, unique, easy to recall, but hard to guess passwords for every app and service without writing them down or storing them anywhere, try devising an algorithm. Here is one example:</p>

               <h4>How Much Is Enough? : A Formula for FU Money</h4>					<small>10 July 2012</small>			
																<p>FU money is defined as: any amount of money allowing perpetuation of wealth necessary to maintain a desired lifestyle without needing employment or assistance from anyone. With only interest (return on investments) as an income, this should last all of the remaining years of my life, while accounting for my lifestyle and inflation.</p>

               <h4>The Only 'Relevent' Ads Are Search Results</h4><small>05 Mar 2012</small>			
                  <p>Marketers these days love to throw this phrase around: if advertising is targeted enough, it becomes "useful information" instead of advertising. That's selfish bullshit trying to give an ethical justification to the fact that they are basically being jerks.</p>

																	<h4>Live Coading</h4><small>02 Mar 2012</small>	
																						<p>Bret Victor's presentation Inventing On Principle was thought-provoking. As a programmer, we have always known this but his emphasis on the point, that an immediate connection to creative output is enormously valuable, forces us to rethink about our tools and how we can improve them.</p>

																	<h4>Why I Will Not Buy Asus Transformer Prime</h4>			<small>14 Jan 2012 </small>	
																							<p>When I first heard about Asus Transformer Prime, I was very excited. This was the first combination of power and portability with a touchscreen that made the cut for me. Other tablets are more of consumption devices, where as I want a device with which I can get some real work done too.</p>

																		<h4>Should We Philosophize?</h4><small>30 Oct 2011</small>
																					<p>Given that philosophy literally means "the love of wisdom", the question can be rather simply stated as "Should we think?". While it may seem trivial, it still needs to be investigated. Let me attempt to understand this question by breaking it down into parts. The affirmative answer is subject to 3 underlying premises as I understand it.</p>

																		<h4>A Quick Introduction To Ruby</h4><small>14 Oct 2011</small>
																						<p>I wrote a no-nonsense introduction to Ruby for people who already know how to program in some other language. This article does not waste time with programming basics or syntax details which one can learn easily anyway. I hope this gets you started in the beautiful, happy world of Ruby.</p>

																		<h4>Ubunto 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) On Dell Vostro 1520</h4><small>11 Jun 2010</small>
																		<p>Dell's Vostro 1520 is a solid notebook for work because of its sturdy build, non-glossy 4:3 screen and performance/price. Ubuntu's latest release on this would be a perfect setup for programmers. However, there are a few quirks here and there with hardware support. Here's what I did to fix them.</p>
