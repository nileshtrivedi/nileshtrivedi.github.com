title: Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) On Dell Vostro 1520
---
<p class="excerpt">Dell's <a href="http://www1.ap.dell.com/in/en/business/notebooks/laptop-vostro-1520/pd.aspx?refid=laptop-vostro-1520&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=inbsd1&amp;~ck=anavml" rel="nofollow">Vostro 1520</a> is a solid notebook for work because of its sturdy build, non-glossy 4:3 screen and performance/price. Ubuntu's latest release on this would be a perfect setup for programmers. However, there are a few quirks here and there with hardware support. Here's what I did to fix them.</p><div class="content"></p><p><!--more--><p><a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso" rel="nofollow">Download</a> the desktop ISO for i386 platform and install normally. I chose to mount <code>/home</code> and <code>/stuff</code> on separate partitions so that I always have the option of chosing upgrade or fresh install when the next release comes around. Dual booting with Windows XP/Vista is no more necessary because of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="nofollow">VirtualBox</a>.</p><p>Remember to stay connected to the Internet during the install. This makes some restricted drivers, like for broadcom wireless card, available to you automatically.</p><p>Once the install is complete, restart your notebook. Connect to the net using ethernet and install all available updates using <code>System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Update Manager</code>.</p><p>First problem is that wireless card does not work. NetworkManager menu shows that "wireless is disabled". Go to <code>System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Hardware Drivers</code> and activate the <code>Broadcom STA wireless drivers</code>. Restart the computer. However, wireless will still not work. To fix, do the following:</p><code>sudo rmmod dell_laptop</code><p>At this point, wireless indicator will light up and after a while, you'll be able to connect to the available wi-fi access points. However, the <code>dell_laptop</code> kernel module will get loaded again on bootup and hence, the fix is not permanent. Let's make it so:</p><code>echo 'blacklist dell_laptop' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-custom</code><p>Wireless should be working fine from now on.</p><p>Next, let's make your <strong>Tata Photon+</strong> wireless broadband card work. The modemmanager package shipped with Lucid is buggy. Hardik has created a patched version which solves this problem. <a href="http://hardik.in/2010/03/20/ubuntu-9-10-reliance-netconnect-broadband-modem-huawei-ec1260-networkmanager-works-out-of-the-box/" rel="nofollow">Here are the instructions</a>.</p><p>After verifying that bluetooth, webcam, memorycard, touchpad and sound are working fine, it's now time to install a few additional packages. First, let's get multimedia support with audio and video codecs, flash and Java plugins, MS fonts:</p><code>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras vlc</code><p>Some basic utilities:</p><code>sudo apt-get install pidgin liferea chmsee inkscape wine cheese gthumb</code><p>Now let's make the system programmer-friendly:</p><code>sudo apt-get install openvpn network-manager-openvpn ssh virtualbox meld</code><p>You might face difficulties in using VPN with NetworkManager. Apply <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/universe-bugs/2009-April/078293.html" rel="nofollow">this patch</a> to fix this problem.</p><p>More goodies:</p><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion git-core gitk git-gui</code><p>Do not forget to install these Firefox extensions:</p><ul><li>Firebug</li><li>Web Developer Toolbar</li><li>Screengrab</li><li>YSlow</li><li>AdBlock Plus</li></ul><p> </p><p>Install <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" rel="nofollow">Google Chrome</a>. It's a great browser for daily usage and you will also be able to test your websites with WebKit.</p><p>And finally, a web developer's toolbox:</p><code>sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server ruby-full sun-java6-jdk</code><p>Enjoy!</p></div><p> </p>
